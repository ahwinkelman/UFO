## Summary:

One drawback of filter is when you search one category it leaves the default placeholders in the other search bars which can be confusing for someone presenting or seeing a city/state not matching up.  Two potential features the enhance this webpage would to provide a drop down menu to help guide user on things to filter by.  Another would be to add images when filtering the list to provide more activity with the user on the page.
